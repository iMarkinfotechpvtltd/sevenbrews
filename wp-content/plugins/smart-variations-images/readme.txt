This is a WooCommerce extension plugin, that allows the user to add any number of images to the product images gallery and be used as variable product variations images in a very simple and quick way, without having to insert images p/variation.

== Description ==

By default WooCommerce will only swap the main variation image when you select a product variation, not the gallery images below it. 

This extension allows visitors to your online store to be able to swap different gallery images when they select a product variation. 
Adding this feature will let visitors see different images of a product variation all in the same colour and style.

This extension will allow the use of multiple images per variation, and simplifies it! How?
Instead of upload one image per variation, upload all the variation images to the product gallery and for each image choose the corresponding slug of the variation on the dropdown.
As quick and simple as that!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The plugin doesnt work with my theme =

Themes that follow the default WooCommerce implementation will usually work with this plugin. However, some themes use an unorthodox method to add their own lightbox/slider, which breaks the hooks this plugin needs.

= The plugin works but messes up the styling of the images =

You can try several options here.

1. Go to WooCommerce > SVI (Smart Variations Images) and activate or deactivate the option "Enable WooCommerce default product image"
2. Disable other plugins that change the Product image default behavior.
3. Read the Support Threads.


= How do I configure it to work? =

1. Assign your product Atrributes and click "Save atributes"
2. Create the variations you need, and click "Publish" or "Save as draft"
3. Go to Product Gallery and upload/choose the images you are going to use
4. For each image assing the slugs to be used for the variation images swap
5. Publish you product

You can skip steps 1 and 2 if your product is already setup with Atributes and Variations.

== Screenshots ==
